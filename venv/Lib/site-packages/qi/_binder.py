        This class decorator specifies that some methods of this class will
        never be called at the same time on the same instance by the qi module,
        by doing the calls sequentially and ensuring thread safety without the
        need of some extra synchronisation mechanism.
        This guarantee only applies to method calls that originate from the qi
        module, which mostly concerns bound methods and methods connected as
        callbacks of signals.
        It does not apply to private methods (methods that start with
        '__'), including but not restricted to __init__, __del__, __enter__ and
        __exit__.
        One consequence of this is that a sequenced method call on an object
        must finish before another sequenced method call on the same object can
        be made.
        This is the default behavior.
